    a- Check domain/local is in ASCII or unicode
        if: (localpart is ascii and domain part is unicode)
            then : convert unicode to ASCII based Punycode 
        if(localpart is ascii and domain part is ascii)
            then : simple REGEX
        if(localpart is unicode and domain part is unicode)
            then : resolve complete address by Punnycode
        if(localpart is unicode and domain part is ascii)
            then : convert the localpart using ASCII based Punnycode
    b- check domain/local if IDNA compliant separatly
